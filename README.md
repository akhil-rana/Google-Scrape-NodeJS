# google-scrape-NodeJS
A really simple NodeJS program to scrape search results from google.com and return them in JSON format using Puppeteer and Cheerio.

## Steps:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Change the value of var `searchKey` to your requirement.
3. Change the value of `numberOfResuls` to your requirement but the actual number may vary close to this.
2. Run `node server.js` or `npm start` to run the program and see the output in console.
